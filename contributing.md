## Development

Work should be based on the `master` branch, with changes PRed in.

If your changes are not breaking, merge them into the `v1` branch, and they'll be picked up by every repo running `v1` automatically.

If your changes ARE breaking, then you should create a `v2` branch based on master and update your chosen repo to use the new workflow.
